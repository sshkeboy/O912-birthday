But here you are, standing here dengan versi kamu yang jauh lebih kuat, lebih berani, jauh lebih hebat. I don't know how many you've went through, but really, i'm really proud of you.. i am really proud of you, i'm really proud for having such a "perfect" man like you. I know you'll say "you're not perfect" but nah, you are still perfect in my eyes with all your flaws in it. If i can tell you how proud i am to have a boyfriend like you, i will show the world of any person that i saw, and tell them that i have such a very very WONDERFUL partner like youu :[.";
